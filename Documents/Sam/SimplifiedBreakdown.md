# Simplified Breakdown V1 15/10/24 10AM

## We are going to make some software that manages events:
- A timeline/calendar of upcoming events will be shown
- Each event will  have information that will be useful to NGO members when organising events
- Data will be stored in a database
- Users can create new events

## We will need to investigate:
- Existing solutions
- How to use GitHub
- Existing library's we can use (steal)
- The data we need to store
- Breakdown the video

## We will need to design:
- The database
- The user interface 
- How to process the data 
- How to input data (Via form or automated)
- How we will work

## To do list:
- Progress log 1 (MOST IMPORTANT)
- Breakdown important info from challenge video
- Task Breakdown
- Who does what task
- create deadlines and a roadmap
- start designing stuff
- Create a domain model (map goals/actors/resources)
- Decide an actual framework and workflow (is c# definitely the right move?)
