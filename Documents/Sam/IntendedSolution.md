# Intended Solution V0.1 14/10/24 7PM

Our solution is a software tool to help members of the NGO organise and manage their cervical screening events. 

The solution will be a proof of concept piece of software that can track upcomming events and their availability in order to help manage advertisement of events and allocation of resources. The solution will be programmed using C# and it will contain an SQLite database. Users will be able to create events and manage their capacity and reallocate attendees that cannot be at a certain event. Each event will have the staff that are linked to be working, the event location, the event capacity, Estimated turnout, and other resources available. The software will act as an aid to NGO event organisers and provide a timeline of planned events with the ablity to add more events to the timeline
